knapping_stone.png is by Skamiz Kazzarch

All others are by durtective6 from the knap mod
<https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?t=20647>.

Both the knap mod and the original knapping mod are both licensed under MIT,
without specifying a separate license for the images. I, CSirolli, have reached
out to both authors concerning this, and will update this document when I have
received a response.
